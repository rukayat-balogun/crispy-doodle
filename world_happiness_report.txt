World Happiness Report from 2015 to 2020

For this Analysis, I am going to visualize the happiness report for country Nigeria.

For this to be achieved, the following has to be done:
i. the column names for all years will be renamed.
ii. the columns will then be filtered
iii. write a for loop to see if all dataset has country Nigeria
iii. since Nigeria is occuring just once in the dataset, the country will be extracted to a new container for all years.
iv. the visualization will be done.
v. the predictive analysis will also be done for see the happiness rate in years to come.
